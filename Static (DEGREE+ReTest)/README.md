Reading is ok.

n = 121423, m = 334419       // The number of nodes and edges

p0 = 81       // The 2-approximate pseudoarboricity computed by DEGREE

Approximation time: 0.061098       // Time consumption of DEGREE

Re-orientation time: 0.002596       // Time consumption of ReTest

Pseudoarboricity: 42       // Exact value of pseudoarboricity
